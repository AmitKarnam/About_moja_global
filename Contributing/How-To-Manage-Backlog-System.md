## The moja Backlog system

The moja Backlog system is designed to be a simple system to manage the backlog of bugs and features.
Two github tools are used to manage the backlog, 'Issues' and 'Projects'. To create a new bug to add to the backlog see [How-To-Report-Bugs](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Report-Bugs.md). To create a new feature request se [How-To-Request-a-New-Feature](https://github.com/moja-global/About-moja-global/blob/master/Contributing/How-to-Request-a-New-Feature.md)

Maintainers should set up the ‘watch’ capacity for projects that they manage to ensure that they are aware of anything that is occurring in the project. It is also recommended that they ‘star’ the relevant pages of the project while they are working as the maintainer.
