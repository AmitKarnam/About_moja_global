# Standard tests

Testing needs to be performed by both developers and maintainers for new or modified code. Developers are expected to perform standardise tests before submitting the pull-request, and maintainers conduct testing when going through the process of assessing a pull-request.
Tests suites should be included in the repositories of existing code, and test suites should be developed for new repositories where tests do not already exist.
The standardised test suites are expected to be completed for all pull-requests. A standardised test suite should include:
1. Unit tests
1. Integration tests
1. System tests
