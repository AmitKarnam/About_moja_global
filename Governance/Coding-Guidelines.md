## C++ Style Guide 

moja global follows the C++ style guide developed by Google for their open-source projects.
The google style guide is aimed at enable coders to utilise the power of C++ while at the same time managing the potential complexity that can arise when coding in C++.

The style guide can be found at: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html

It is possible that exceptions to the google style guide may be specified, in which case they will be listed here.
Currently there are no exceptions.
