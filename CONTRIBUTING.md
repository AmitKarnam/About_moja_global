## How to Review & Contribute Science Design?

Every science-based project contains Science Designs under a directory named **Science**. There you can find:

* Markdown (or `.md`) files that contain link to a Science Design document that is under development.

For instructions on how to contribute Science Designs, please read [this](Contributing/How-to-Contribute-Review-Science-Design.md) document.

You should read the Science Design documents of a project, before contributing to it.
