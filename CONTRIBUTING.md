# moja global Contribution Guideline

We're very glad that you're thinking about contributing to moja global. We welcome all contributions!

Following are some general guidelines and instructions to assist you in contributing to our projects.


## Code of Conduct

moja global and everyone participating in it are governed by the Contributor Covenant [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to info@moja.global. If you want your report to be handled confidentially, please report to guy@moja.global.


## FAQ and General Questions

If you have any questions then please start by going through our [FAQs](https://github.com/moja-global/.github/wiki). If your question is not answered there, please write to info@moja.global.

If your question is related to the code of a project, then please create a [new issue] in the relevant repository.

You're also invited to [join moja global](Contributing/How-to-Join-moja-global.md) and ask your question(s) in the relevant channel of our private [Slack workspace](https://mojaglobal.slack.com/).


## How To Get Credit for Your Contribution?

We use the [All Contributors Bot](https://allcontributors.org/) to recognize contributors.

To get recognized, just add the following sentence in a comment after making your contribution (like submitting a pull request, replying to a question, resolving an issue, etc.):

```
@all-contributors please add <@username> for <contributions>
```

Here `<@username>` is your GitHub username and `<contributions>` can be any word from [this list](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) but the bot can use [basic Natural Language Parsing](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot/blob/master/src/tasks/processIssueComment/utils/parse-comment/index.js) to determine your contribution intent.

After that, the @all-contributors bot will submit a PR to include `<@username>` in the list of contributors. Once this PR is accepted, you'll be added to the list of contributors in the relevant project's `README`.


## How to Contribute Code?

Bug fixes, performance improvements, formatting style -- there are a lot ways in which you can contribute code! Please have look at the issues list of our projects to find an issue that you can help us with.

After that, go through our [coding guidelines](Governance/Coding-Guidelines.md) and [contribution criteria](Governance/Contribution-Criteria.md) before making any contributions.

To increase the chances of your code getting merged, please ensure that:
* Your submission follows [Vincent Driessen's Git Branching](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) System.
* Your code is documented according to our [documentation rules](Contributing/How-to-Document-Your-Contribution.md).
* Your pull request:
    * passes all checks and has no conflicts.
    * has a well-written title and message that clearly describes your proposed changes.

Lasly, make sure that the commits in your pull requests are signed with the line

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

This shows that you agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) and thus certifies that you wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) your contribution to the project.


## How to Report Bugs, Provide Feedback or Request Features?

To submit bug reports, provide feedback or to request new features, please create [a new issue] in the repository of the relevant project.


## How to Review & Contribute Science Design?

Most of our code is informed by an underlying Science Design. We develop these designs collaboratively and we welcome all contributions!

Science Design documents can be found in a directory named **Science** at the root of a relevant project's repository.

There can be two types of Science Design files:
* PDFs that contain completed Science Designs.
* Markdown (or `.md`) files that contain link to a Science Design document that is under development.

If you're planning on contributing to a project then please make sure to go through its completed Science Design documents.

For instructions on how to contribute Science Designs, please read [this](Contributing/How-to-Contribute-Review-Science-Design.md) document.


## How to Suggest UI/UX Improvements?

One of the most important areas of improvement to our flagship software FLINT is the user interface. We really need your help here!

If you have and idea on how we can imporove then please share it with us by creating a [new issue]. We can then [start a new project](Contributing/How-to-Start-a-New-Project.md) for your idea!


## How to Contribute Translations?

Right now our interfaces do not support translations and we also don't have a translation strategy in place.

But we want to reach as many people as possible, including those who do not speak English well.

So, if you any idea then please advise us on how we can facilitate contributions from those who are not comfortable in English. You can share your ideas by creating a [new issue].
